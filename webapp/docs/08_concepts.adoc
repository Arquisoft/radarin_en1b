== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== _Domain model_

=== _Domain Concepts_

|===
| Name        | Description
| User    | Represents the user of the application. It is identified by the username, that must be unique to each user. Since the application provides the option for users to be notified by nearby user friends, the current location of the user and a reference to a list of all of the friends of the user must be also used.
| Location     | Represents a location that the user might want to store in the server. This location will have a name, and the current coordinates of the location will also be stored.
| Coordinate     | Represents the coordinates of a user or of a location. It will store in its attributes the specific height, width... of the concrete coordinate. 
|===


=== _Architecture and Design Patterns_

The architecture of the application will be built around the MVC philosophy, dividing the different sections of the application in different areas to assure everything works fine and to ease the work that might take to implement quality changes.

=== _User Experience_

==== _User Interface_

The user interface will be made using React.

==== _Ergonomics_

The application will not have a high learning curve since the functionality will be very clear because of the usage of maps, thus guaranteeing that users of all ages may be able to use the application.

==== _Internationalization_

Due to the nature of the course (being a bilingual subject, taught in English), English must be supported, although Spanish might be supported too.

=== _Security & Safety_

==== _Security_


==== _Safety_

No part of the application has life endangering aspect since all the information is stored in pods.


=== _Development Concepts_

==== _Build, Test, Deploy_

The system will be deployed from docker containers and also deployed in a cloud service like heroku. The application will be tested in a run automatically continuous integration server.

==== _Code generation_

==== _Migration_

==== _Configurability_

=== _Under-the-hood_

The persistence of the data is supported in the system, since the web application will store the information the users work with; hence, as long as the user keeps connected, the data will be correctly stored in the server. 
A transaction will be made when the user wants to store a location in the server, if somehow the transaction fails due to a network issue, such location will be stored to later be stored when the network is restored.
The communication between the application and the web application will only be noticed by the user when they want to store the location, since it may take a little delay to connect to the server.

=== _Operation Concepts_
