== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== _Domain model_

=== _Domain Concepts_

|===
| Name        | Description
| User    | Represents the user of the application. It is identified by the username, that must be unique to each user. Since the application provides the option for users to be notified by nearby user friends, the current location of the user and a reference to a list of all of the friends of the user must be also used.
| Location (current location of user)    | Represents the current location of the user, that will be constantly updated within the app, to track the location of the user.
| Location (uplodaded by the user)     | Represents a location that the user might want to store in the server. This location will have a name, a description of the uploaded location, and the current coordinates of the location will also be stored.
|===


=== _Architecture and Design Patterns_

The architecture of the application will be built around React components, trying to respect their life cycle and taking advantage of that in order to implement the functionality. This way, we can implement the design within the functionality and keep doing calls to different functions and components.
Taking this into account, functionalities and components will be separated in different .js files that will be called in the design. With this, we can have different modules that implements different functionalities, making each component more differentiated.

=== _User Experience_
The experience of users when first using the application will be a simple to use and easy to learn process, with the help of techniques like familiarization (if we are used to something in the real world, modelling in an application will give the user the confidence and knowledge of having
used it before, such as a map, or a very simple UI). With this, a lot of prototyping is involved, as developers will find it easy because they have developed it and know where everything is placed.

==== _User Interface_

The user interface will be made using https://reactjs.org/[React framework], a component based framework capable of complex UIs. The idea for the UI is to be simple, but at the same time be able to have all the features necessary for the development of the final product.

==== _Ergonomics_

The application will not have a high learning curve since the functionality will be very clear because of the usage of familiarization, thus guaranteeing that users of all ages will be able to understand and use the application.
As the UI is simple to learn and use, the amount of rejection by the user is reduced, and so, a happy user.

=== _Security & Safety_

No part of the application has life endangering aspects since all the applications asks for is the user's information, which will be securely stored using Pods. Thus, the only time the user provides information to the application is via login, and only their id and the same locations the user adds in the application will be used, mainting the confidentialy of their profile. Resulting in the user specfying the information to be shown.
Using HTTP protocols, we ensure the security and the integrity of all the data that the application may exchange with the server.

=== _Development Concepts_
The ability to:

- Design complex but easy to learn/use UIs

- Understand the functionality of Docker and Heroku

- Have knowledge of Javascript

- Work in teams

- Properly use a online repository

- Be able to do research

- Make quick decisions that will prevent the development to be stopped

==== _Build, Test, Deploy_

The system will be deployed from docker containers and also deployed in a cloud service called heroku. The application will be tested in a run automatically continuous integration server, which will allow us to make sure that everything is running and working in real time.

==== _Code generation_

The application will be made using React framework, a framework based around the use of components, which allows for the posibility to design complex UIs with the composition of different components. It is written using Javascript, which also allows for the use of 
external plugins to further improve flexibility and increment the application.

==== _Migration_

When migrating as all information is stored in Pods for each user, all data is recovered when logging into the application, friends, reviews, pictures is all recovered from the cloud.

==== _Configurability_
The user should be able to configure:

- The map radius.

- The application sends the location to the server.

- The information shown to friends.


=== _Under-the-hood_

The persistence of data is supported in the system, since the web application will store the information the users work with; hence, as long as the user keeps connected, the data will be correctly stored in the server. 
A transaction will be made when the user wants to store a location in the server, if somehow the transaction fails due to a network issue, such location will be saved to later be stored when the network is restored. Other possible errors should be managed, closing the application safely and asking the user to report the error 
The communication between the application and the web application will only be noticed by the user when they want to store the location, since it may have some delay when connecting to the server.
The sessions will be managed using the tools provided by Javascript.
Validation of data is also provided within the app, checking that data introduced by the user has the expected type.
