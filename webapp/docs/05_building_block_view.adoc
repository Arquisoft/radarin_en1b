== Building Block View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image:05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.
****

=== Whitebox Overall System (Scope & Context)

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

Motivation::

The Radarin System is accessed by two types of actors (users & administrator) which conects to the Solid POD Provider to access the user personal data.
The system will be subdivided into two main software components to meet the project requirements.


Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|**Name** | **Responsability**
|Radarin | Whole system designed to be used by users and administrators and able to conect to the user POD provider.

|Solid POD Provider | Neighbour system that store the POD for each of the users.
|===

// Not yet implemented. 
////
Important Interfaces::
_<Description of important interfaces>_
////

[role="arc42help"]
****
Insert your explanations of black boxes from level 1:

If you use tabular form you will only describe your black boxes with name and
responsibility according to the following schema:

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| _<black box 1>_ | _<Text>_
| _<black box 2>_ | _<Text>_
|===



If you use a list of black box descriptions then you fill in a separate black box template for every important building block .
Its headline is the name of the black box.
****
////

==== <Name black box 1>

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe <black box 1>
according the the following black box template:

* Purpose/Responsibility
* Interface(s), when they are not extracted as separate paragraphs. This interfaces may include qualities and performance characteristics.
* (Optional) Quality-/Performance characteristics of the black box, e.g.availability, run time behavior, ....
* (Optional) directory/file location
* (Optional) Fulfilled requirements (if you need traceability to requirements).
* (Optional) Open issues/problems/risks

****

_<Purpose/Responsibility>_

_<Interface(s)>_

_<(Optional) Quality/Performance Characteristics>_

_<(Optional) Directory/File Location>_

_<(Optional) Fulfilled Requirements>_

_<(optional) Open Issues/Problems/Risks>_




==== <Name black box 2>

_<black box template>_

==== <Name black box n>

_<black box template>_


==== <Name interface 1>

...

==== <Name interface m>

////

=== Level 1

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system
****

Motivation::

Show the decomposition of the Radarin system in the two software components, how both of them relate with the different actors in the application and the way they interact with the User POD and other neighbour systems.


Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|**Name** | **Responsability**
|Mobile Application | Used by users to recive notifications from nearby friends and sending locations to the server.

|Web Application | Used by the users to manage and visualize locations and by the administrator to manage users and monitor server status. It accesses the user data by means of the POD.

|Server Database | Database used by the Web Application to store Locations and the minumum amount of data needed from the users. Also used by the Mobile application to access relevant information of the system stored in the Database.

|User POD | Provided by the Solid POD Provider, stores the personal data of the user such as his/her friend list.

|Server Monitoring Tool | Foreign System in charge of monitoring the server status.

=== Level 2 

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 2 as white boxes.

When you need more detailed levels of your architecture please copy this
part of arc42 for additional levels.
****

Motivation::

Show the decomposition of the Web Application to include relevant parts of the main part of the system, the web application.

Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|**Name** | **Responsability**
|Components | JavaScript components created by React as a way of building blocks of code and ensure reusability and independence.

|ComponentsTests | Tests included in the web application to ensure the proper functioning of the React components.

|Services | Clases of the application in charge of interacting with the Solid POD's and using the user data in a proper way.
