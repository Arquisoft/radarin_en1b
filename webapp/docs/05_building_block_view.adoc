== Building Block View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes,
interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations,
datas structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image:05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.
****

=== Whitebox Overall System (Scope & Context)

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

Motivation::

The Radarin System is accessed by two types of actors (users & administrator) which conects to the Solid POD Provider to access the user personal data.
The system will be subdivided into two main software components to meet the project requirements.


Scope & Context:
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|**Name** | **Responsability**
|Radarin | Whole system designed to be used by users and administrators and able to conect to the user POD provider.

|Solid POD Provider | Neighbour system that store the POD for each of the users.
|===



==== Level 1

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 1 as white boxes.

You have to decide which building blocks of your system are important enough to justify such a detailed description.
Please prefer relevance over completeness. Specify important, surprising, risky, complex or volatile building blocks.
Leave out normal, simple, boring or standardized parts of your system
****

Motivation::

Show the decomposition of the Radarin system in the two software components, how both of them relate with the different actors in the application and the way they interact with the User POD and other neighbour systems.


Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|**Name** | **Responsability**
| Mobile Application | Used by users to recive notifications from nearby friends and sending locations to the server.

|Web Application | Used by the users to manage and visualize locations and by the administrator to manage users and monitor server status. It accesses the user data by means of the POD.

|Server Database | Database used by the Web Application to store Locations and the minumum amount of data needed from the users. Also used by the Mobile application to access relevant information of the system stored in the Database.

|User POD | Provided by the Solid POD Provider, stores the personal data of the user such as his/her friend list.

|Server Monitoring Tool | Foreign System in charge of monitoring the server status. 
|===


==== Level 2 

[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you can specify the inner structure of (some) building blocks from level 2 as white boxes.

When you need more detailed levels of your architecture please copy this
part of arc42 for additional levels.
****

Motivation::

Show the decomposition of the Web Application to include relevant parts of the main part of the system, the web application. A more concise decomposition will be shown in the following section.

=== Level 3 

image:05_level_3_diagram.png["Level 3 blocks diagram"]

Motivation::

Inner diagram of level 3, focusing in the internal structure of level 3. In this subsection the interaction between the Views used by the user, the components and the elements deboted to interact with the User POD is shown.

Contained Building Blocks::
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|**Name** | **Responsability**
|Views | Different Vies created in Javascript for the user interaction. These are the parts of the application which the user may travel during their interaction with the Radarin application.

|Components | JavaScript components created by React as a way of building blocks of code and ensure reusability and independence.

|Solid Accessing | Functions dedicated to interact with the User POD from the web application. These blocks are a key part of the web since they would be used by those views which want to show User information as well as by other internal parts of the application, like the Redux Toolkit

| Redux Toolkit | Toolset composed of several utility functions used to facilitate the implementation of Redux in the application. Redux has been used to manage the sate of the session and administrate the User Locations.
