== Design Decisions


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationals.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision
* ADR (architecture decision record) for every important decision
****


In this section of the documentation, each important decision will take place making use of a specific format related to
the topic: *ADR* (_architecture decision record_), a document that captures a decision, but also including, inter alia,
the context or the consequences.

=== React for User Interfaces

Context::

The basis of this project rests on two important foundations, two applications designed for both web and mobile.
Then, as the MVC (model-view-controller) is the software design pattern used, something is needed for building user
interfaces.

Decision::

In order to achieve this goal, we have decided to use *React*, which is a JavaScript library created by Facebook
with that precise intention. It may be seen as a requirement at first, but it is only a given advice so we use it in the
development of Radarin.

Status::

Accepted.

Consequences::

React, as it has already been said, is a framework for creating complex UIs based on components. The main reasons for using
it are its simplicity, its native aproach and its high testability.
