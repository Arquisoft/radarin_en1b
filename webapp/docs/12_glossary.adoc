.Contents
The most important domain and technical terms that your stakeholders use when discussing the system.

You can also see the glossary as source for translations if you work in multi-language teams.

.Motivation
You should clearly define your terms, so that all stakeholders

* have an identical understanding of these terms
* do not use synonyms and homonyms

.Form
A table with columns <Term> and <Definition>.

Potentially more columns in case you need translations.

| Cloud server     | A cloud server is a pooled, centralized server resource that is hosted and delivered over a network and accessed on demand by multiple users.
| Container     | A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
| Continuous integration   | Continuous Integration is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day.
| Controller    | A controller is a program component that serves as a mediator between a user and application and handles business-related tasks triggered in user interface field.
| Docker     | Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
| Ergonomics     | Software ergonomics is a subcategory of ergonomics that concerns the software design, rather than the hardware design, of systems. Software ergonomics includes the determination of user needs, interface design, user support and usability testing.
| Heroku     | Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS)that allows develoopers to build, run and scale applications supporting several programming languages such as Ruby, Java, Node.js, Python.

| MVC     | Model–view–controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements.

| Server     | A computer or computer program which manages access to a centralized resource or service in a network.
| SOLID     | In object-oriented computer programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
| System deployment     | The deployment of a system is its assembly or transformation from a packaged form to an operational working state.
| Under-the-hood   | Used to introduce the underlying implementation of a software. Implies that the implementation is not intuitively obvious from the appearance, but the speaker is about to enable the listener to grok it.
| Virtualization     | Virtualization is the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.
| Web application     | A web application is application software that runs on a web server, unlike computer-based software programs that are run locally on the operating system of the device.
