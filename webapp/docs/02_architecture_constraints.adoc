== Architecture Constraints


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)

=== Technical Constraints
[options="header",cols="1,4"]
|===
|Constraint |Explanation

|SOLID
|The system must be compatible with the https://solidproject.org/[SOLID project, window="_blank"], an initiative developed by Tim Berners-Lee and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology focused on a new approach to the web centrated on the decentralized exchange of public and private data by means of the pods.

|Docker
|The system will be deployed from https://www.docker.com/[docker, window="_blank"] containers.

|Heroku
|It will also be deployed in a cloud service like https://www.heroku.com/[heroku, window="_blank"].

|GitHub
|Git is used as the version control technology for this project and https://github.com/Arquisoft/radarin_en1b[GitHub, window="_blank"] will be the plataform used for the team not only to keep control of the development and implementation, but also as a place to colaborate and discuss, write the minutes for each meeting, ...

=== Organizational & Political Constraints
[options="header",cols="2,3"]
|===
|Constraint |Explanation

|Team Size
|The team has 6 members, so the amount of work should be constrained to this size.

|Lack of Experience
|The team members have little or almost no experience with most of the technologies used.

|Limited Time
|The development of the entire project has to be done in a limited time of about 3 months. Then, the features of the project have to be be constrained to this time span.

|Other projects & Subjects
|All of the members of the team have other quite time-demanding subjects, so the time and effort invested in the project will not be as high as we desire.

=== Conventions
[options="header",cols="1,4"]
|===
|Constraint |Explanation

|Clean Code
|The implementation of the project has to reach a high degree of maintenance and extension.

|Language
|The project has to be developed in english in its entirety due to the bilingual course principles.

|Documentation
|The documentation of the project uses both the https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc, window="_blank"] text document format and the https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor, window="_blank"] open source text processor in order to convert the former to HTML5. The documentation will also follow the https://arc42.org/[arc42, window="_blank"] template.
